# MemeMe
For IOS Developer Course Completion - Project 2.1

This app will allow you to create a Meme either by choosing a photo from your photoalbum or taking a picture by the camera. You can add any text you like to add
either at the top or bottom text fields. You also can share the edited Meme and save it to your photoalbum.

I used IBOutlets and IBActions, protocols and delegete methods,struct and dictionary, UIImagePickerController and UIActivityViewController.

Some help were taken from the below references:

Enjoy Meme-ing.
